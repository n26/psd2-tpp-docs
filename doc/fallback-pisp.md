## Access & Identification of TPP

### Base URL

`https://pisp.tech26.de`

#### On-boarding of new TPPs

1. A TPP shall connect to the N26 PSD2 API by using an eIDAS valid certificate (QWAC) issued
2. N26 shall check the QWAC certificate in an automated way and allow the TPP to identify themselves  with the subsequent API calls
3. As the result of the steps above, the TPP should be able to continue using the API without manual involvement from the N26 side
> :information_source: Certificates can be renewed by making an API call **using the new certificate**, which will then
> be onboarded automatically.

### Characteristics of this solution

#### Identification of TPP through QWAC

Please use your QWAC certificate when making any request on `pisp.tech26.de`.

#### Data which needs to be stored & provided

Third parties will need to store following data in order to access the API:

* device token

Additionally, Third parties are obliged to send following data in every request to our API:

* device token : `device-token: {{device_token}}`
* real user ip: `x-tpp-userip<span id="1973177c-3174-44a7-bc31-8d826f00a77a" data-renderer-mark="true" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="1973177c-3174-44a7-bc31-8d826f00a77a">: {{userip}}</span>`

> :warning: TPP should provide a unique `device_token` per client/device connection. `device_token` must be a valid UUID v4 as per RFC 4122.

##### Importance of `x-tpp-userip`

All payment initiation-related API calls must include the IP address of the end-user in the `x-tpp-userip` header. From a technical point of view, providing this IP address** guarantees us to identify proper user calls** and to  **protect the integrity of our services** .

Since our Fallback API is based on our original API for our mobile and web apps, there are a lot of security measures built-in. Many of these security measures track the end-user IP addresses and prevent frequent calls from different IP addresses for the same user (amongst other features, that we do not disclose for security reasons). If a TPP doesn't provide an end-user’s IP address with API requests requiring IP specification, or tries to manipulate or obfuscate IP addresses, such cases will be treated in accordance to our established security policies applied to the original API.

> :warning: According to PSD2 (Level1) Art. 94 (1) we require the end-user IP to be specified with every end-user generated request. Monitoring end-user IPs on the N26 side is necessary to safeguard the prevention, investigation and detection of payment fraud. In case N26 security measures applied to the API detect unusual user-related activity, such cases will be processed in accordance with the established security policies, including (but not limited to) rate limiting, blocking request by IP and reporting such cases to the regulatory authorities.

#### Data which should not be stored :warning:

As per Art 22 (1), (2b) and Art 33(5a) of [Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.069.01.0023.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:069:TOC##d1e1565-23-1 "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.069.01.0023.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2018:069:TOC##d1e1565-23-1") TPPs should **NOT store passwords (incl. PINs)** of users!

> CHAPTER IV
>
> CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE PAYMENT SERVICE USERS' PERSONALISED SECURITY CREDENTIALS
>
> Article 22
>
> Payment service providers shall ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the personalised security credentials of the payment service user, including authentication codes, during all phases of the authentication.
>
> For the purpose of paragraph 1, payment service providers shall ensure that each of the following requirements is met:
>
> a) […]
>
> b) personalised security credentials in data format, as well as cryptographic materials related to the encryption of the personalised security credentials are not stored in plain text;

> Section 2
>
> Specific requirements for the common and secure open standards of communication
>
> Article 33
>
> Contingency measures for a dedicated interface
>
> […]
>
> For this purpose, account servicing payment service providers shall ensure that the payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) can be identified and can rely on the authentication procedures provided by the account servicing payment service provider to the payment service user. Where the payment service providers referred to in Article 30(1) make use of the interface referred to in paragraph 4 they shall:
>
> a) take the necessary measures to ensure that they do not access, store or process data for purposes other than for the provision of the service as requested by the payment service user;

> :warning: If we identify the TPP is doing this, we reserve the right to block those accesses.

#### Validity of access tokens


|                | **Access Token**                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**    | Access for API calls in**one session**          |
| **How to get** | 1. Email & password1.**Push**(OOB) or SMS (OTP) |
| **Validity**   | 15 min                                          |
| **Storage**    | NEVER                                           |

> :warning: Access tokens are supposed to be used only for  **1 session (sequence of calls)** .
> If a user requests initiation of a new payment a new access token has to be requested **EVEN** if the original access token is still valid.
> For this reason the TPP should **NEVER** store the access token.

> :warning: The TPP should not use these access tokens on other base URLs than `pisp.tech26.de`.

> :x: If those policies above are not respected, there is no guarantee you will not be rate-limited.

## User Authentication

### Overview

![User Authentication](./assets/fallback-user-auth-flow.png)

### Step 1 - Start authentication with username & password

#### Request

```
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
device-token: {{device_token}}
x-tpp-userip: {{userip}}

username={{username}}&password={{password}}&grant_type=password
```

##### Parameters

`device_token` is a unique identifier of device. Has to be the same per installation.

For syncs from the backend, this has to be unique and persisted per user.

`userip` has be populated with the real user ip.

> :information_source: Only the headers mentioned here are necessary

#### Responses

### Step 2a - Recommended - Continue authentication with Two-Step Certification (OOB)

This type of authentication triggers a second factor authentication notification on a user mobile device.

#### Request

```
POST /api/mfa/challenge HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
device-token: {{device_token}}
x-tpp-userip: {{userip}}
 
{ 
   "mfaToken": "{{mfaToken}}",
   "challengeType": "oob"
}
```

#### Responses

##### Successful

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
    "challengeType": "oob"
}
```

User received a push notification with the request to authorise this connection.

##### Unsuccessful

In case `device_token` is incorrect or `mfa_token` is incorrect.

```

## Payment Initiation

### Overview

In order to make requests to the payment initiation endpoints such as SEPA DT or Standing Orders it is necessary to supply  **encrypted-secret** and **encrypted-pin** headers. These parameters can be obtained by encrypting the user PIN which TPPs shall ask from the user in the same manner as email and password during authentication.

> :warning: A TPP shall not store the PIN provided by a user and should treat it the same way as a user’s password. 
> Please refer to the [Data which should not be stored](./fallback-pisp.md#data-which-should-not-be-stored-warning) section for more details.

We provide an additional endpoint `/api/encryption/key` which should be used to obtain an encryption key which in turn is used to encrypt the user PIN.

In the following sections we provide the step-by-step guide on how to obtain the encryption key and use it to generate **encrypted-secret** and  **encrypted-pin** .

### User PIN Encryption

#### Step 1 - Getting User PIN

As the first step before initiating any payment a TPP needs to request a user to provide a PIN. PIN is the four digit passcode for confirming payment initiation. The PIN code should be treated the same way as user password and shouldn’t be stored on the TPP side for future usage. In other words, whenever a TPP initiates a transactions, they should ask for the user input providing the PIN code every time.

#### Step 2 - Getting Encryption key

In order to generate `encrypted-secret` and `encrypted-pin` headers for payment initiation endpoints, the next step should be getting a public key to be used for PIN encryption.

**Request**

```
GET    /api/encryption/key HTTP/1.1
Authorization: bearer {{access_token}}
x-tpp-userip: {{userip}}
device-token: {{device_token}}
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Response**

```
{
  "publicKey": "..." # Base-64 encoded public key.
}
```

**Example (Bash)**

```bash
public_key=$(curl -k --key $CLIENT_KEY_FILE --cert $CLIENT_CERT_FILE -s -H "Authorization:Bearer $access_token" https://pisp.tech26.de/api/encryption/key | jq -r '.publicKey')
```

#### Step 3 - Encrypting User PIN

After you obtained the public key from the previous step, the next step would be to encrypt the user PIN and get  **encrypted-secret** and **encrypted-pin** as a result. A short walkthrough follows (with example code in Bash).

1. Generate an AES-256 key/IV of your choice, for example:

```bash
aes_secret_raw=$(openssl enc -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -k $AES_SECRET_KEY -P)
aes_key_hex=$(echo "$aes_secret_raw" | grep "key\s*=" | sed -e "s/.*=//")
aes_iv_hex=$(echo "$aes_secret_raw" | grep "iv\s*=" | sed -e "s/.*=//")
```

2. Encode this key and IV as a JSON string (collectively, this data is the secret) with the following format:

```json
{
  "secretKey": "{key encoded as Base-64}",
  "iv": "{iv encoded as base-64}"
}
```

Bash:

```bash
aes_key_base64=$(echo $aes_key_hex | xxd -r -p | base64)
aes_iv_base64=$(echo $aes_iv_hex | xxd -r -p | base64)
unencrypted_aes_secret=$(jq -n --arg key "$aes_key_base64" --arg iv "$aes_iv_base64" '{secretKey: $key, iv: $iv}')
```

3. Encrypt the secret JSON with RSA using the provided public key. Note: Use PKCS##1 v1.5 padding; this is the default for openssl in the sample below, but may not be with other technologies. Then convert the encrypted secret to base-64:

```bash
rsa_public_key=$(echo -e "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n$public_key\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" | sed -r 's/(.{67})/\1\n/g')
mkdir -p $TEMP_FOLDER
echo "$rsa_public_key" > $TEMP_FOLDER/rsa_public_key.pem
encrypted_secret=$(echo $unencrypted_aes_secret | openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey $TEMP_FOLDER/rsa_public_key.pem -pubin | base64 | tr -d '\n')
rm $TEMP_FOLDER/rsa_public_key.pem
```

4. Encrypt the user’s PIN, as a string, with AES-256, using the key/IV generated in step 1, and convert this to base-64:

```bash
encrypted_pin=$(echo $PIN | tr -d '\n' | openssl enc -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -K $aes_key_hex -iv $aes_iv_hex | base64 | tr -d '\n')
```

As a result, you get `encrypted_secret` on Step 3 and `encrypted_pin` on Step 4. Starting from this point you can use the payment initiation endpoints described below.

We provide the full Bash script to encrypt the user PIN for your convenience here: [Bash Script for User PIN Encryption 
and Initiating Transaction](./assets/bash/pin_encryption_and_initiating_transaction.sh). Feel free to use this sample script or come up with your alternative implementation in the language of your choice.

#### Step 4 - Initiate a payment

At this step you should have everything necessary to make a call to one of the payment initiation endpoints listed below. Please make sure to repeat the process of getting the user PIN, the new encryption key and generating the `encrypted_secret` and `encrypted_pin` with every new transaction, even for the same user.

## Get Status of Initiated Transactions

### Overview

Access to lists of *user transactions* and *standing orders* is provided as a means of identifying whether a transaction has been successfully initiated. Since every transaction needs to be certified by a user via a  mobile app, payment initiation endpoints listed in the previous section, return only a transaction ID and can’t guarantee that the transaction will be booked. The result of the user confirmation (certification) of a transaction can be queried by making the GET transaction lists requests.

If a transaction is present on a list of transactions, it means that a user has accepted the certification and all validations have been completed.

* To check the **SEPA DT** transaction statuses, please use  **Main Account Transaction List** : Each N26 user has only one payment account, which is the Main Account. All transactions successfully initiated and certified by a user appear on the Main Account Transaction List. Transaction list of the main account is provided via `/api/smrt/transactions`
* To check the **Standing Order** transaction status, please use  **Standing Order Transaction List** : Approved Standing Orders don’t appear on the list of Main Account Transaction List, but on the separate list of Standing orders provided via `/api/transactions/so` with a not null `"userCertified”`field.

> :information_source: For  **Standing Orders** , don’t forget to check the `"userCertified"`field
Not yet confirmed Standing Orders have `"userCertified": null`
Confirmed Standing Orders have not null `"userCertified"`
