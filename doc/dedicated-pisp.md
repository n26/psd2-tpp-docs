## General information

Berlin Group Conformity : [Implementation Guidelines version 1.3.6](https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads "https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads")

Authorisation protocol: [oAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/ "https://oauth.net/2/")

Security layer: A valid QWAC Certificate for PSD2 is required to access the Berlin Group API, and should be included in every request. The official list of QTSP is available on the [European Comission eIDAS Trusted List](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/##/ "https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/##/"). For the N26 PSD2 Dedicated Interface API, the QWAC Certificate must be issued from a production certificate authority.

> :information_source: Certificates can be renewed by making an API call **using the new certificate**, which will then
> be onboarded automatically.

## Access & Identification of TPP

### Base URL

`https://xs2a.tech26.de`

### Sandbox URL

`https://xs2a.tech26.de/sandbox`

### On-boarding of new TPPs

1. A TPP shall connect to the N26 PSD2 dedicated API by using an eIDAS valid certificate (QWAC) issued
2. N26 shall check the QWAC certificate in an automated way and allow the TPP to identify themselves  with the subsequent API calls
3. As the result of the steps above, the TPP should be able to continue using the API without manual involvement from the N26 side

> :information_source: **PISP flow does not provide refresh tokens for security purposes**

> :warning: The TPP should not use those access tokens on base URLs other than `xs2a.tech26.de`. Access tokens issued for PISP cannot be used for AISP flows.

## Authentication endpoints

These endpoints are used to retrieve an access token for use with the /payments endpoints.

Note: any values shown between curly braces should be taken as variables, while the ones not surrounded are to be read
as literals.

### Initiate authorization

This begins the authorization process. Users should be redirected to the URL supplied in the response.

#### Sample request

```

#### Sample Response

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: https://app.n26.com/open-banking?requestId=0daa152a-651a-4592-8542-47ff60799deb&state=1fL1nn7m9a&authType=XS2A
```

### Retrieve Token

When users are redirected back from the URL supplied in the previous request (step 7 of the sequence diagram), the
following two query string parameters should be extracted and verified

* **state** - should match the state supplied in the initiate authorization request
* **code** - this is the authorization code which will be used to retrieve the token

As an example, if the TPP provided “https://www.tpp.com/redirect“ as redirect_uri, after the users have successfully
logged in, the TPP can expect a redirection to the following URL:

`https://www.tpp.com/redirect?code=dbtF5AqOApjjSnNF5TK3w3gaEPdwtV2&state=1fL1nn7m9a`

Upon receiving this redirect, the TPP can make the following request to retrieve the access token:

#### Sample Request

```
POST    /oauth2/token?role=DEDICATED_PISP HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&
code=dbtF5AqOApjjSnNF5TK3w3gaEPdwtV2&
code_verifier=foobar&
redirect_uri=https://tpp.com/redirect
```

#### Get payment status

This endpoint is intended to be polled by the TPP to determine whether the users have confirmed the payment (as we are
using the decoupled SCA approach).

Payment final status `ACSC` will be applied in most cases **at the end of the day ** after reconciliation from 
Bundesbank. Until then, the payment may stay in the intermediate status `ACFC`. 

Statuses currently supported:

| **Status code** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RCVD            | Received. Initial status for a payment. A certification has been sent to the user’s app.|
| ACCP            | AcceptedCustomerProfile. User has confirmed the in-app certification and the payment has been successfully initiated. |                   _
| ACFC            | AcceptedFundsChecked. User has enough funds to perform a payment, and a hold has been applied on the funds. _(Supported from 31/03)_ |
| ACSC            | AcceptedSettlementCompleted. Payment execution process has been successfully completed by N26. This is **NOT** a confirmation that the beneficiary has received the funds. _(Supported from 31/03)_|
| RJCT            | Rejected. Payment failed to be initiated or executed.| 

The final status of a payment is either **ACSC** or **RJCT**.

### Instant SEPA Credit Transfers

#### Initiate Instant SEPA Credit Transfer

> :information_source: Please note that the **debtorAccount** parameter is not mandatory; if this parameter is excluded,
> the payment will be executed from the customer's main account.

Customers are required to accept ___Terms and Conditions___, specifically for the SEPA Instant feature, once prior to performing
the transfer. Furthermore, non-premium customers (i.e. customers with an N26 Standard account) are charged a fee for
each instant transfer. This fee differs by market, ranging from €0.49-€1.99, and can be found on the N26 website of the
relevant market.

##### Request

        }
    }
}
```

Customers should accept the ___Term And Conditions___ for the SEPA Instant feature prior to performing the first transfer.
In the event that the customer has not accepted the ___Terms And Conditions___ for the SEPA Instant feature, before initiating the transfer, the following response would be sent to the TPP:

```
HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
Location: https://n26.com
```

> ⚠️: The temporary redirect is the end of the payment initiation. After the customer has accepted the Terms and Conditions, the TPP is required to make a new POST request to initiate the payment again in order for it to be executed.

#### Get payment status

This endpoint is intended to be polled by the TPP to determine whether the users have confirmed the payment (as we are
using the decoupled SCA approach).

Payment final status will be applied no later then **15 minutes. **

#### Get status of periodic payment

This endpoint provides statuses on both the creation and deletion of periodic payments. The statuses provide information on the rule itself, and not the 
subsequent execution of payments. Once the rule has been successfully created, the final status would be "ACCP". Once the rule has been successfully deleted, 
the final status would be "CANC". 

As users are required to provide confirmation for both the creation and deletion of periodic payments, and we are using the decoupled SCA approach, this 
endpoint is intended to be polled by the TPP.

Statuses currently supported:

| **Status code** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                       |

| ACCP            | AcceptedCustomerProfile. User has confirmed the in-app certification to create a periodic payment, and the periodic payment has been successfully created. |

| CANC            | Cancelled. User has confirmed the in-app certification to **delete** a periodic payment, and the periodic payment has been successfully deleted.                                                                             |
> :warning: When a periodic payment is being deleted, the status will only change from ACCP to CANC once the in-app certification to **delete** the periodic payment 
> has been confirmed by the user. If the in-app certification expires or is denied by the user, the status will remain ACCP.
