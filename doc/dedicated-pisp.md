## General information

Berlin Group Conformity : [Implementation Guidelines version 1.3.6](https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads "https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads")

Authorisation protocol: [oAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/ "https://oauth.net/2/")

Security layer: A valid QWAC Certificate for PSD2 is required to access the Berlin Group API. The official list of QTSP is available on the [European Comission eIDAS Trusted List](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/##/ "https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/##/"). For the N26 PSD2 Dedicated Interface API, the QWAC Certificate must be issued from a production certificate authority.

> :information_source: Certificates can be renewed by making an API call **using the new certificate**, which will then 
> be onboarded automatically.  

## Access & Identification of TPP

### Base URL

`https://xs2a.tech26.de`
### Sandbox URL

`https://xs2a.tech26.de/sandbox`

### On-boarding of new TPPs

1. A TPP shall connect to the N26 PSD2 dedicated API by using an eIDAS valid certificate (QWAC) issued
2. N26 shall check the QWAC certificate in an automated way and allow the TPP to identify themselves  with the subsequent API calls
3. As the result of the steps above, the TPP should be able to continue using the API without manual involvement from the N26 side

## OAuth as a Pre-step

OAuth2 is supported by this API through the authentication of a PSU in a pre-step, as per the diagram below:

Access tokens issued for PISP cannot be used for AISP flows.

## Authentication endpoints

These endpoints are used to retrieve an access or refresh token for use with the /consents and /accounts endpoints.

Note: any values shown between curly braces should be taken as variables, while the ones not surrounded are to be read as literals.

### Initiate authorization

This begins the authorization process. Users should be redirected to the URL supplied in the response.

#### Sample Response

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: https://app.n26.com/open-banking?requestId=0daa152a-651a-4592-8542-47ff60799deb&state=1fL1nn7m9a&authType=XS2A
```

### Retrieve Token

When users are redirected back from the URL supplied in the previous request (step 7 of the sequence diagram), the following two query string parameters should be extracted and verified

* **state** - should match the state supplied in the initiate authorization request
* **code** - this is the authorization code which will be used to retrieve the token

As an example, if the TPP  provided “https://www.tpp.com/redirect“ as redirect_uri, after the users have successfully logged in, the TPP can expect a redirection to the following URL:

`https://www.tpp.com/redirect?code=dbtF5AqOApjjSnNF5TK3w3gaEPdwtV2&state=1fL1nn7m9a`

Upon receiving this redirect, the TPP can make the following request can be made to retrieve the access and refresh tokens:

#### Sample Request

```
POST    /oauth2/token?role=DEDICATED_PISP HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&
code=dbtF5AqOApjjSnNF5TK3w3gaEPdwtV2&
code_verifier=foobar&
redirect_uri=https://tpp.com/redirect
```

### Get payment status

This endpoint is intended to be polled by the TPP to determine whether the users have confirmed the payment (as we are using the decoupled SCA approach).

Payment final status will be applied no later then **15 minutes. **

Statuses currently supported:


| **Status code** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                       |

| RCVD            | Received. Initial status for a payment. A cerification has been sent to the user’s app.                                                                              |
